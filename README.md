Here are some basic instructions on how to run the server.

In order to run the server you need to install Node.js (and the bundled npm) from the [Node.js site](http://nodejs.org/).
Other developer tools that you need can then be installed by running the following npm commands:
```
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Optional, but recommended for development:
```
npm install -g node-inspector
```

### Install dependencies
Dependencies can be installed by running the following commands:

npm start
```
